About
We are an interdisciplinary team working on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying vital biological processes. In particular, we are interested in biological membranes, proteins, and their interactions which have applications in medicine, biochemistry and biotechnology. We develop and use unique theoretical and computational tools for multiscale modeling ranging from all-atom to very coarse-grained (single particle per molecule). We verify the simulated results by experiments in our lab. Our motto is: "Improve the well-being of humankind by understanding peptide-membrane interactions."

Research
Our research group is dedicated to unraveling the fundamental mechanisms of PROTEIN-MEMBRANE and PROTEIN-PROTEIN interactions that regulate protein self-organization and membrane remodeling. These interactions are crucial for understanding cellular signaling and transport and for addressing pressing challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, cancer, and viral infections.

Protein-Membrane Interactions
We investigate how proteins interact with cellular membranes, focusing on protein self-organization and membrane remodeling. By examining the interplay between lipid composition and protein properties, we aim to understand how the lipid membranes influence protein function and how proteins, in turn, self-organize to modify membrane shape and properties. Our work includes studying membrane-active peptides with antimicrobial, fusogenic, and curvature-sensing or modulating properties. Learn more about this research HERE.

Protein-Protein Interactions
Our research also explores protein-protein interactions, with a focus on liquid-liquid phase separation and the interactions of viral capsid subunits. We investigate the specific protein properties and conditions that promote the formation of liquid droplets and membrane-less organelles, both essential for cellular signaling and regulation. Additionally, we study how viral proteins drive the assembly and genome release of viral particles, providing insights into mechanisms of viral infectivity. Learn more about this research HERE.

Multidisciplinary Approach and Facilities
To address these complex biological questions, we employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates computer simulations, theoretical modeling, and experimental assays. We develop and apply novel computational models with a multiscale perspective to explain and predict complex phenomena in biomolecular systems. Our fully equipped laboratory allows us to conduct a wide range of biophysical assays and safely work with BSL-2 pathogens. Supported by our dedicated laboratory staff, we leverage the strengths of each method to gain novel insights into biological processes. Additionally, we have access to the CEITEC Core Facilities, which provide specialized services, training, and expertise across multiple scientific domains. Learn more about Core Facilities HERE.
