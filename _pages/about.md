既然选择了远方，便只顾风雨兼程。

**My Bilibili channel**: [东山月光下](https://space.bilibili.com/441196634). From time to time, I will share full courses, specialized mini-lecture, animated demonstrations and cutting-edge lectures in macromolecular structure study, molecular dynamics simulation/statistical thermodynamics, oncology and immunology. English-Chinese dual subtitles are added for videos from YouTube. Please subscribe and triple click (一键三连)!

## Projects & Tools

I created a **VScode syntax highlighting extension** [md-highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gxf1212.md-highlighter) that highlight files about molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. This extension provides comprehensive coverage of commonly used file formats under various popular tools, including Gromacs, Amber, AmberTools, NAMD, VMD, and more. It also performs detailed keyword parsing, helping users to locate and edit information within files more quickly. Users can even identify syntax errors quickly based on different colors. Feel free to download and try it out, and don't hesitate to recommend it to your colleagues!

The site's bottom left corner (after hiding the outline) features **a Live2D hostess** [三体风Live2D看板娘](https://github.com/gxf1212/live2d-widget) that I've carefully curated with many favorite quotes from the famous science fiction "The Three-Body Problem". If you're interested, you can fork the project or contribute some sentences of your own.
